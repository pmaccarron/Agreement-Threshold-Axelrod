'''
Axelrod -- Agreement Threshold
==============================

30-August-2019

This is an adjustment of the original agreement threshold
(named _bc_traits) suggested by Guillaume Deffaunt

- Pick a random couple of neighbouring agents:

- Compute proba of interaction = (nb of features with difference
    <= threshold) / total nb of features

- With this proba, choose randomly one feature where the
    agents are different with a difference below threshold.
    Then one copies the feature of the other.
